Utilizing node.js, javascript, and npm modules to command and call select apis based on user input.

Commands that user can use are:
1. "concert-this"
    Using this command, user can input a band or artist they would like to see their concerts. It will display where the concert is located and the time the concert happens. This utilizes the BandsInTown api.
2. "spotify-this-song"
    This calls for a song title based on what the user use. Drawing data from the spotify api, it will display the song name, artists, which album it came from, and a preview link of the song.
3. "movie-this"
    This command uses the OMBd api to search for a movie the user input and display information regarding that movie.
4. "do-what-it-says"
    This one draws data from a .txt file that has information already in it. LIRI will then read from this file and run the appropiate command and functions, which then will dislpay it onto the terminal based on what kind of command was written.
